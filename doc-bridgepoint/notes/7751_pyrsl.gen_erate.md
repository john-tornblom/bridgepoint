# pyrsl as a replacement for gen_erate.exe
### xtUML Project Analysis Note

1. Abstract
-----------
The bridgepoint toolchain currently rely on a windows-only interpreter called gen_erate.exe to execute RSL archetype files. To execute these parts of the tool chain on a non-windows machine, wine must be used. Rather than using wine, an experimental interpreter called pyrsl may be used instead.This note aims to investigate if pyrsl is feasable as a replacement to gen_erate.exe
